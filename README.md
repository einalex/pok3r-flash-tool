# pok3r-flash-tool
Beginning of a python script that allows reading and writing the flash of a vortex pok3r from linux

Will try to read the flash when run. There is no user interface of any kind (not even cli) yet.
Feel free to contribute.

== Dependencies

 - python 3
 - pyusb


== ToDo

 - change firmware to allow reading of the flash (this requires finding the right position and flip a few bytes)
 - flash modified firmware
 - read flash
