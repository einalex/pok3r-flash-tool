# pok3r-flash-tool

Beginning of a python script that allows reading and writing the flash of a Vortex Pok3r from Linux (and possibly other operating systems)

The script will try to read the flash when you run it. There is no user interface of any kind (not even cli) yet.
The code should be pretty straight forward even though it isn't cleaned up yet.

Poke around.
Feel free to contribute.


## Dependencies

You need the following to run this script

 * python 3
 * pyusb

I think this tool might be OS agnostic, but I haven't tested that.
What I can say is that it works on Linux.


## ToDo

 * change firmware to allow reading of the flash (this requires finding the right position and flip a few bytes)
 * flash modified firmware
 * read flash


## Drinks / Donations

Someone suggested to put up a way people can donate.
So if you want to do that feel free to send some bitcoins my way. bitcoin address: 1Hb5csKUkLjH1JUXzbNfgMtvZaSX7MFLWC
I wanted to try that out anyway.
